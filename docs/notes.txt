=================================================================================================
On optimization:
We saved on time by moving the uv calculations from the fragment shader to the vertex shader, 
which optimizes better on certain architectures. To further increase performance, we want to 
reduce the number of texture reads as much as possible.


3x3 gaussian convolution complexity
-------------------------------------------------
The Laplacian convolution is not seperable [18]. However, can we use the Gaussian function
instead and get acceptable results? It works in the photoshop implementation [16], so why not here? If
it doesn't work, we can sacrifice correctness for speed by switching to a five-point stencil
from the current nine-point stencil. The following are some notes on the Gaussian convolution.

Where x is resolution in the x direction,
y is resolution in the y direction,
c is the width of the convolution kernel,
and we're using a test image of 512x512 with a 3x3 convolution kernel:

The naive implementation has a complexity of
    O( xy * c^2 )
The number of operations on the test image is 2,359,296

Break into two passes (one horizontal, one vertical) to reduce the complexity to
    O( xy * 2c )
The number of operations on the test image is 1,572,864
This represents a 33% speed increase over the naive implementation.

When you're using GL_LINEAR, you can sample between pixels to fetch the interpolated information for both.
Using this trick we can can simplify it to
    O( xy * 2(int(c / 2)) )
The number of operations on the test image is 1,048,576
This represents a 66% speed increase over the naive implementation.

We could probably get away with only two texture reads for the image if we use two corners of the
center pixel!

The theoretical best-case performance is O(xy), or 262,144 operations [13]
This represents an 89% speed increase over the naive implementation.


3x3 gaussian:
1 2 1
2 4 2
1 2 1

Our laplacian:
0.05 0.20 0.05
0.20 -1.0 0.20
0.05 0.20 0.05

Standard laplacian (with diagonals):
0.25 0.50 0.25
0.50 -3.0 0.50
0.25 0.50 0.25

Standard Laplacian (no diagonals):
0.00 1.00 0.00
1.00 -4.0 1.00
0.00 1.00 0.00

Fragmentarium laplacian:
https://github.com/Syntopia/Fragmentarium/blob/master/Fragmentarium-Source/Examples/2D%20Systems/Reaction-Diffusion.frag
0.50 1.00 0.50
1.00 -6.0 1.00
0.50 1.00 0.50
(seems to be the standard multiplied by two)


The Laplacian is the second derivative of the Gaussian.

Other way of doing it [16]:
Highpass (6 Pixels)
Threshold (Level 127)
Gaussian Blur (9 Pixels)
